# Custom toolbar with save option
This example shows how to a create custom toolbar with ""Save"" option. It is not possible to edit the default toolbars, so you need to create a new toolbar with required tool items. 

Here, we have disabled the default toolbar using the EnableNavigationToolbar, EnableAnnotationToolbar, and EnableToolbar properties of the SfPdfViewer and have created a custom toolbar.
