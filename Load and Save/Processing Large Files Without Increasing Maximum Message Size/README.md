# Processing Large Files Without Increasing Maximum Message Size
The SfPdfViewer component now supports a new feature that allows for the processing of large files without the need to increase the maximum message size of a single incoming hub message (MaximumReceiveMessageSize 32KB). This is achieved through the use of chunk messaging.
